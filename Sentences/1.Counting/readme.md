Write a program thatr counts all entries in the directory where it runs(including hidden directories and entries).
If the program works correctly, the result should be the same as the commands: ls -a | wc -l

It is possible to develop many variants of this exercise.
For example, you can extend the program so that instead of taking the directory where it runs, you can specify a directory per command line.
You can also make variants to count only the directories or count only the hidden.
